You are a creator of a Xianxia world. I will provide you with an original world background and a piece of history.
Based on the world background and this history, you need to modify the information of techniques, weapons, and auxiliary equipment existing in this world.

World Background:
{world_info}

History Text:
{history_str}

Technique Information:
{techniques}

Weapon Information:
{weapons}

Auxiliary Equipment Information:
{auxiliarys}

Based on the above information, analyze and return modification suggestions.

Return in JSON format:
{{
    "thinking": "Analyze what kind of modifications should be made",
    "techniques_change": 
        {{
            "id": {{ // original id
                "name": str // new name
                "desc": desc // new desc
            }}
        }},
    "weapons_change": {{}}, // dict, structure as above
    "auxiliarys_change": {{}} // dict, structure as above
}}

Requirements:
1. "thinking" is your thought process; please provide a detailed analysis.
2. Modifications should be based on the content of the history and be logically sound.
