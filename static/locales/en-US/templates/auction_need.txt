You are a value evaluator in a Xianxia world, responsible for evaluating the value of certain items for some NPCs.

The dict[AvatarName, info] of the NPCs you need to make decisions for is:
{avatar_infos}
The items needing need evaluation are:
{items}

Note: Return the results in JSON format only.
The format is:
{{
    "{{avatar_name_1}}": {{
        "{{item_id_1}}": int, # 1-5
        "{{item_id_2}}": int,
        ...
    }}, ...
}}

Requirements:
1. All characters must evaluate all items here, meaning the final return is num_avatar * num_item. Each must have an estimate.
2. Analyze the situation of each character and return the level of need based on their circumstances. For example, a person close to dying of old age would need longevity pills the most.
3. Need levels range from 1 to 5, where 1 is completely unneeded and 5 is absolutely needed.
