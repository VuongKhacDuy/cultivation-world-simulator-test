Return in JSON format:
{{
    "analysis": "...", // Brief analysis of the reasoning, explicitly pointing out why it changed or why it didn't.
    "changed": true | false, // Whether a relationship change occurred.
    "change_type": "ADD" | "REMOVE", // Type of change. Can be ignored when changed is false.
    "relation": "LOVERS" | "FRIEND" | "ENEMY" | "MASTER" ... (Must be uppercase enum name), // The relationship involved. Can be ignored when changed is false. Note that this is the status of {avatar_a_name} relative to {avatar_b_name}. For example, if the output is MASTER, it means A becomes B's master.
